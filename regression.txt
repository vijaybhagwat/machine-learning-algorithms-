REGRESSION
==========
IT IS A PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS TOOL WHICH PREDICTS THE BEST FIT LINE TO YOUR CONTINIUOS DATA.
ASSUMPTIONS :
1. YOUR INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VARIABLE SHOULD HAVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP AMONG THEMSELF.
2. ERROR ARE I.I.D. RANDOM VARIABLE WHICH SHOULD BE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED 
3. VARIANCE OF Y AT EVERY VALUE OF X SHOULD BE SAME(HETEROSCEDACITY) 
4. YOUR INDEPENDENT VARIABLE SHOULD NOT BE HIGHLY CORRILATED WITH EACH OTHER(MINIMAL MULTI-COLINIEARITY)
*TERMS USED IN REGRESSIONS 
1.CORRELATION
A STATISTICAL MEASURE WHICH DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES AND GIVES YOU THE DIRECTION OF THAT RELATIONSHIP
2. R SQUARE(COEFFICIENTS OF DETERMINANT)
IT DETERMINES THE STRENGHT OF DATA/ ACCURACY OF YOUR MODEL. 
IT ASLO SHOWS BEST FIT LINE TO YOUR REGRESSION EQUATION
3. MULTICOLINIEARITY 
IT OCCURS WHEN YOUR INDEPENDENT VARIABLES ARE HIGHLY WITH EACH OTHERS.
TO DEAL WITH IT WE USE SCALING METHODS LIKE STANDARDIZATION OR NORMALISATIONS(MIN-MAX SCALER)
4. VIF(VARIANCE INFLATION FACTORS)
IT IS MEASURE TO CALCULATE MULTICOLINEARITY IN YOUR DATA
5. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN R SQUARE AND ADJUSTED R SQUARE
R SQUARE ASSUMES THAT EVERY SINGLE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE(X) EXPLAIN VARIATION IN DEPENDENT VARIABLE(Y) BUT
ADJUSTED R SQUARE TELLS YOU THE % OF VARIATION WHICH CAUSED BY INDEPENDENT VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS DEPENDENT VARIABLE
